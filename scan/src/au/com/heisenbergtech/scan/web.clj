  "Rules for the Clojure web stack -- hiccup, ring, reitit.

  This is the bucket Java fills with 103 Spring and JavaEE rules. The
  framework differs; the vulnerability classes do not. XSS (CWE-79), CSRF
  (CWE-352) and credential exposure (CWE-200, CWE-522) were the largest
  remaining gaps against Java's coverage, and all three live in framework
  usage rather than in the language.

  No generic analyzer ships these for Clojure, because they require knowing
  what hiccup's escaping guarantees are and where ring's middleware sits."
