  Stated twice, these sets drift: `definline`, `defstruct` and `gen-class`
  were counted as functions and classes by the metrics while the highlighter
  left them unstyled, because each namespace kept its own list. `special` is
  derived from the others rather than restated, so a form added below cannot
  be a function to one consumer and an ordinary symbol to another.

  Strings, not symbols: the parser hands us text, and `(symbol text)` on
  arbitrary source is a coercion that can only lose."
