  The call-shaped rules -- eval, read-string, sh, jdbc, MessageDigest and the
  rest -- moved to clj-kondo/hbt/security.clj, where they key on the RESOLVED
  var instead of matching a name as text. What remains here is shape-based: a

  string literal, a shell call with only literal arguments.

  db)` is not evidence of anything, and treating it as a sink accuses most of
  the data layer.

  A SQL statement is a string. A string statement handed in from elsewhere is
  the cross-file injection shape, and a bare symbol is what that looks like at
  the sink. `dangerous-sinks` still covers the case where the building happens
