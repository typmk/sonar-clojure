  "The concurrency hazards Clojure actually has.

  Most of Java's concurrency rules do not port: there is no `synchronized`
  to forget, no `volatile` to miss, no double-checked locking to get wrong,
  and shared data is immutable by default. That is the language doing its
  job, and reproducing those rules here would be theatre.

  What survives is narrower and specific to Clojure's coordination
  primitives, and it is the kind of defect that passes every test on a quiet
  machine and only appears under contention."
