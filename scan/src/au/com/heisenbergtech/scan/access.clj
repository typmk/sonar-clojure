  "Rules for the access kernel, keyed on this codebase's own vocabulary.

  Java fills CWE-285 and CWE-287 with rules about Spring Security
  annotations. The vulnerability class is the same and the vocabulary is not:
  here authorisation is `:obj/owner` scoping, a grant lattice and an operator
  that must never be a party. Those invariants are stated in CLAUDE.md and
  enforced by nothing.

  The motivating defect is real and was shipped: WEB-184, where a nil owner
  meant BOTH \"untenanted, shared by design\" and \"lookup failed\" -- and
  both branches allowed. A two-valued test on a three-valued question. No
  general-purpose analyzer can find that, because only this codebase knows
  that `:obj/owner` is the tenant boundary.

  Everything here is a hotspot rather than a vulnerability. The shapes are
  strong signals, not proofs, and a wrong accusation about authorisation is
  the fastest way to get a security ruleset switched off."
