  "Security rules for the Java libraries Clojure calls.

  The premise: Clojure runs on the JDK and reaches for the same
  `MessageDigest`, `Cipher`, `SSLContext`, `DocumentBuilderFactory` and
  `ObjectInputStream` as Java does, so it inherits the same CVE classes.
  Sonar's Java analyzer cannot see any of it -- it parses Java source, and
  measured against this server its 720 rules share no repository with Scala's
  41 or Kotlin's 145. Each JVM language pays for its own.

  What it does NOT try to reproduce: the Java rules about Java's syntax --
  null dereference, equals/hashCode, try-with-resources, mutable statics.
  Those are meaningless here. Nor most of Java's concurrency rules, since
  Clojure's defaults are immutable; the concurrency hazards Clojure DOES have
  are its own, and live in au.com.heisenbergtech.scan.concurrency.

  Class names are resolved through the ns form's :import, so both
  `(MessageDigest/getInstance ...)` and
  `(java.security.MessageDigest/getInstance ...)` match the same rule."

  This table STAYS in code, unlike the metadata. The argument predicates are
  regular expressions -- programs, not content -- and moving them to JSON
  would mean either losing reader-syntax validation or inventing a matcher
  DSL to put it back. The metadata moved because a title, a severity and a
  CWE are content: reviewable by someone who does not write Clojure, and
  translatable. A class/member/regex triple is neither.

  Consistency would argue both belong in resources. That is the Occam
  reading. These are two concerns that happen to sit near each other -- WHAT
  to detect, and HOW to describe it -- and they are already correctly
