  "The project's own vocabulary, enforced.

  CLAUDE.md opens with `The enemy of progress is inconsistency` and carries a
  `Banned -> use` table: dimension becomes facet, slot becomes :taxon/factor,
  custody becomes controller, visibility becomes scope. Until now that table
  was enforced by a human re-reading it.

  Every keyword in the codebase is already in clj-kondo's analysis output --
  namespace, name, position and enclosing var -- so this needs no parsing of
  its own. It consumes what the symbol table already reads.

  This is the one rule set no upstream analyzer will ever ship, because the
  vocabulary is this organisation's."

(def banned
  "Banned keyword -> what to use instead, keyed as clj-kondo reports it:
  [namespace name], namespace nil for a bare keyword.

  DELIBERATELY NARROWER than CLAUDE.md's full table. Measured against lume,
  sur, forma and scout, the generic entries fired on keys this codebase does
  not own: `:err` is clojure.java.shell/sh's return shape, alongside `:exit`
  and `:out`. You cannot rename another library's contract, and a rule that
  demands it gets switched off.

  What remains are terms distinctive enough that a match is this project's own
  vocabulary. The generic ones are listed in `ambiguous` below, off by design."

  `:audience` is the sharpest case: the Banned table says audience -> scope,
  while the Access section defines the access kernel AS `audience +
  sensitivity + capability` and glosses scope as `audience (who may see)`.
