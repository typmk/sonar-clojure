  "Parses Clojure source with rewrite-clj and flattens the tree into the
  annotated node stream every other namespace consumes.

  rewrite-clj rather than a hand-written lexer because it keeps whitespace
  and comments as nodes, so `#_` and `(comment ...)` are recognisable as
  structure instead of guessed at, and head position is a tree fact rather
  than a stack heuristic.

  NOT tools.analyzer: that resolves and macroexpands, which means loading the
  namespace. A scanner that evaluates the code it is measuring is a scanner
  that runs your side effects on the CI box.

  Positions are 1-based with `end-col` exclusive, matching both rewrite-clj
  and clj-kondo. Conversion to Sonar's 0-based offsets happens at the edge."
